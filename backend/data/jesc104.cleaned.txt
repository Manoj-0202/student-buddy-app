Carbon is an element of immense significance to us in both its elemental form and as compounds. 
Most items are made up of compounds of carbon. 
All living structures are carbon based. 
The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide. 
Carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity. 
The atomic number of carbon is 6. 
Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration. 
Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. 
The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. 
A single covalent bond is formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms. 
Covalently bonded molecules have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-molecular forces are weak. 
The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with widely varying physical properties. 
In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional structure. 
In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array. 
Diamond is the hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. 
Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and temperature. 
Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. 
The nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number of compounds. 
Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules.
